Using the [Kivy](https://kivy.org) Python library to create a paddle ball game.

# Kivy Paddle Ball Game

I have been looking for an application to build that I care about somewhat and have come up with something that I am interested in developing. However, I wanted to create something that was cross-platform and had a GUI. So, I thought I'd start my journey with a smaller step - getting know one of my cross-platform GUI framework options, in this case, Kivy. I've followed the [tutorial](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html) offered to re-produce they game they describe and then modified it to learn more before creating my next project.

## Project Goals

- ~~Basic understanding of Kivy~~
- ~~Separate the widgets from the main file~~
- Integrate logging
- Integrate setup
- Cross-platform installers
